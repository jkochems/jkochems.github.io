<dt><strong>Tax Havens in Germany</strong></dt>
single-authored <br />
<dd><div style="text-align: justify"> In a world with heterogeneous tax systems, profit maximizing firms which try to minimize their
overall tax burdens, have an economic incentive to strategically shift their wealth and income between
regions. Some regions cater to these firms by offering very low tax rates, trying to attract the foreign
tax base to their jurisdiction. These regions are widely known as tax havens. Academic studies so far
have focused on investigating the size and fiscal consequences of international tax havens. In many
countries, e.g. Germany and the USA, corporate taxes are in part set at the sub-national, i.e. state
or municipal, level. I argue that, similar to international tax havens, sub-national governments have an 
incentive to attract tax bases to their jurisdiction by choosing very low corporate tax rates. I label these
regions <em>local tax havens</em>. So far there is no systematic information on the occurrence and size of local tax
havens. In this project I will investigate local tax havens in Germany. I draw on administrative data on
the municipal and establishment level to estimate the fiscal and economic effects of local tax havens in
Germany. <br /> </div> </dd>

<dt><strong>Trade Shocks and Local Public Finance: Evidence from German Municipalities</strong> </dt>
with Adrian Lerche <br />
<dd><div style="text-align: justify"> In this paper, we investigate the effect of import and export shocks on German municipalities’
local business tax (LBT) bases and fiscal outcomes for the period from 1992 to 2012. Import shocks
have a detrimental effect on local outcomes, while export shocks increase LBT bases as well as municipal
revenues and expenditures. The effect on expenditure patterns depends on municipalities’ initial fiscal
and economic conditions. Results are stronger in the 2002 to 2012 period than in the 1992 to 2002 period.
We find that our results are mostly driven by trade between municipalities located in West Germany and
Eastern Europe. <br /> </div> </dd>

<dt><strong>The Local Economic Impact of US Troop Withdrawals in Germany</strong> </dt>
with Jakob Schmidhäuser <br />
<dd><div style="text-align: justify"> What are the local economic impacts of foreign troop deployments? To answer this question,
we exploit variation from the historical large-scale U.S. troop withdrawal from Germany at the end of
the Cold War for identification. Administrative data by the U.S. Department of Defense enables the
precise quantification of the shock at the municipal level. We find negative effects on local labor markets,
which transmit to municipal finances. Revenues go down, which municipalities counter by decreasing
their expenditures while increasing property tax multipliers. Long time-series enable us to show in a
dynamic DID setup that these negative effects persist until today and often even increase over time.
Persistently higher intergovernmental transfers allocated to affected municipalities alleviate the negative
fiscal impacts. <br /> </div> </dd>
