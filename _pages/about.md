**Tax Havens in Germany** <br />
single-authored <br />
*Abstract*: In a world with heterogeneous tax systems, profit maximizing firms which try to minimize their
overall tax burdens, have an economic incentive to strategically shift their wealth and income between
regions. Some regions cater to these firms by offering very low tax rates, trying to attract the foreign
tax base to their jurisdiction. These regions are widely known as tax havens. Academic studies so far
have focused on investigating the size and fiscal consequences of international tax havens. In many
countries, e.g. Germany and the USA, corporate taxes are in part set at the sub-national, i.e. state
or municipal, level. I argue that, similar to international tax havens, sub-national governments have an 
incentive to attract tax bases to their jurisdiction by choosing very low corporate tax rates. I label these
regions *local tax havens*. So far there is no systematic information on the occurrence and size of local tax
havens. In this project I will investigate local tax havens in Germany. I draw on administrative data on
the municipal and establishment level to estimate the fiscal and economic effects of local tax havens in
Germany. <br />
