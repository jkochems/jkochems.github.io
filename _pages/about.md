<dt><strong>Trade Shocks and Local Public Finance: Evidence from German Municipalities</strong> </dt>
with Adrian Lerche <br />
<dd><div style="text-align: justify"> In this paper, we investigate the effect of import and export shocks on German municipalities’
local business tax (LBT) bases and fiscal outcomes for the period from 1992 to 2012. Import shocks
have a detrimental effect on local outcomes, while export shocks increase LBT bases as well as municipal
revenues and expenditures. The effect on expenditure patterns depends on municipalities’ initial fiscal
and economic conditions. Results are stronger in the 2002 to 2012 period than in the 1992 to 2002 period.
We find that our results are mostly driven by trade between municipalities located in West Germany and
Eastern Europe. <br /> </div> </dd>

<dt><strong>The Local Economic Impact of US Troop Withdrawals in Germany</strong> </dt>
with Jakob Schmidhäuser <br />
<dd><div style="text-align: justify"> What are the local economic impacts of foreign troop deployments? 
To answer this question, we exploit variation from the historical large-scale US troop withdrawal from Germany 
at the end of the Cold War. We use administrative data from the US Department of Defense to precisely quantify 
the troop withdrawal's size at the municipal level. We deploy a Synthetic Difference-in-Differences (SDID) estimator 
to estimate the impacts of the troop withdrawal on local outcomes. Our results show negative effects on local labor 
markets and municipal public finances. Local business tax revenues decrease. Affected municipalities react by lowering 
their expenditures, while increasing property tax multipliers.<br /> </div> </dd>
