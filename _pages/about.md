<dt><strong>Job Market Paper: Local Tax Havens</strong></dt>
single-authored <br />
<dd><div style="text-align: justify"> This paper analyzes the fiscal impact of corporate profit shifting to local tax havens. 
Similar to international tax havens, subnational jurisdictions have an incentive to reduce their local business tax rate to attract corporate profits. 
I define local tax havens as low-tax municipalities with a large dependence on sectors that can be exploited for profit shifting. 
I document that local tax havens are situated in close proximity to large agglomerations, while the profit-to-wage ratios documented in these jurisdictions are exceptionally high. 
I deploy synthetic difference-in-differences methods, combined with administrative data sources and standard profit-shifting equations, to estimate the amount of profit shifting to local tax havens. 
Between $2013$ and $2019$, around $52$ billion Euros of corporate profits were shifted to local tax havens. The results are driven by a small number of large firms that offer business and financial services. 
The fiscal cost to non-tax haven municipalities amounts to roughly $7.9$ billion Euros, while tax haven municipalities gain around $4.3$ billion Euros in tax revenues. 
I conduct a case study on the emergence of Germany's largest local tax havens. I estimate that between $2012$ and $2019$, around $20.5$ billion was transferred to its jurisdiction. 
The increase in local tax revenues is used to reduce public debt burdens and finance a high level of public expenditures. <br /> </div> </dd>

<dt><strong>The Local Economic Impact of US Troop Withdrawals in Germany</strong> </dt>
with Jakob Schmidhäuser <br />
<dd><div style="text-align: justify"> What are the local economic impacts of foreign troop deployments? 
To answer this question, we exploit variation from the historic large-scale US troop withdrawal from Germany triggered by the end of the Cold War. 
We use US Department of Defense administrative data to precisely quantify the troop withdrawal's size at the municipal level. 
Using a Synthetic Difference-in-Differences estimator, we find that there are negative effects on local labor markets. Per a withdrawn US soldier, the number of local jobs decreases by 0.69. 
The decrease in economic activity results in a reduction of revenues for affected municipalities. 
To balance decreased revenues, affected municipalities lower their expenditures, while increasing business and property tax multipliers. 
Viewed as a place-based policy, the US troop deployment was rather ineffective in creating local employment. 
We estimate the cost per job to be USD USD 85,200 of US military spending. We supplement the municipal-level data with a worker-level analysis. 
We document that workers displaced by the closure of a US military base have persistently lower employment rates. 
At the same time, their daily wages are around $9.2$ percent lower fifteen years after their layoff. 
The negative impact on labor outcomes is particularly pronounced for women, older workers, and those employed in regions with more unfavorable initial labor market conditions.<br /> </div> </dd>

<dt><strong>Trade Shocks and Local Public Finance: Evidence from German Municipalities</strong> </dt>
with Adrian Lerche <br />
<dd><div style="text-align: justify"> In this paper, we investigate the effect of import and export shocks on German municipalities’
local business tax (LBT) bases and fiscal outcomes for the period from 1992 to 2012. Import shocks
have a detrimental effect on local outcomes, while export shocks increase LBT bases as well as municipal
revenues and expenditures. The effect on expenditure patterns depends on municipalities’ initial fiscal
and economic conditions. Results are stronger in the 2002 to 2012 period than in the 1992 to 2002 period.
We find that our results are mostly driven by trade between municipalities located in West Germany and
Eastern Europe. We supplement our municipal-level analysis with administrative data on corporate tax returns at the firm-level. 
We document that the aggregate results are driven by very large manufacturing companies. We do not find any spillover effect on the taxable profits of non-manufacturing firms.<br /> </div> </dd>
